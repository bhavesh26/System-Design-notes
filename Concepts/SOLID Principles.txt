Solid principles:

1 . S => singleton class
a class should have single instane of it and whenever it invoke that class the active instance should be returned
this is useful in case of database connection, managing sockets  , axios interceptor
( learn more about axios interceptor)

2. a class should be open more extension and close for modification
a class once made should never get modified it should only be open for extension properties in base class should never change
